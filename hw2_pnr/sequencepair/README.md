# Sequence Pair

sequence pair & constraint graph

## problem

- construct constraint graph from sequence pair
- recover the floorplan from the constraint graph

hint: longest path (topo sort)

## build

```
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake .. 
make
```

## requirements

- complete the code in ``./src/ConstraintGraph.cc``
- some naive cases in ``./dataset``
- the left bottom corner of the floorplan is supposed to be (0, 0)
- you can plot the floorplan using ``plot_floorplan.py``
